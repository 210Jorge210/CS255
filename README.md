Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
- The Client was DriverPass. They wanted a system where a user can access to help leanr skills and creat appoints with instructors to pass the diving test at the DMV.
  
What did you do particularly well?
- I felt I was able to fully grasp the clients needs and create an outline that was easy for non technical uses to follow in order to proceed with future stems of plannin the system. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   ensuring that the users needs are met is vital, becasue they typically have a better idea of what is needed within theit system. They may know problems that may arise. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
- I read the transcripts of the clients discussions and looked at their concerns and problems they want addressed. Creating  a list to ensure that at minimum their concerns are
  completed when creating the system.
